    "life_story": (
    "I’m a final-year student at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad, and I’ve always been someone who learns best by doing. "
    "Outside my coursework, I’ve spent a lot of time building small projects, experimenting with data, APIs, and AI systems, and figuring out how things actually work end to end. "
    "Over time, I realized I enjoy taking ownership, moving fast, and building things that solve real problems rather than just looking good on paper."
    ),

    "superpower": (
    "My biggest superpower is mental and emotional resilience. "
    "Once I decide on a goal, I stay disciplined and consistent even when things get uncomfortable or uncertain. "
    "That stability allows me to think clearly, stay creative under pressure, and keep moving forward instead of reacting emotionally."
    ),

    "growth": (
    "I’m actively working on deepening my technical skills, especially around building reliable AI agents and backend systems that can run autonomously. "
    "As new tools and frameworks evolve, I make it a habit to quickly learn, test, and apply them rather than just reading about them. "
    "Alongside this, I’m improving how I explain technical decisions simply and decisively so execution stays fast and aligned."

    "misconception": (
    "Some people initially think I’m distant or not very social because I don’t talk unnecessarily or force conversations. "

    ),

    "boundaries": (
    "I push my boundaries by deliberately taking on problems slightly beyond my current comfort zone. "
    "Instead of waiting to feel ready, I start building, make mistakes quickly, and adjust based on what I learn. "
